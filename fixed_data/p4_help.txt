# How to play
The rules of the game are [here](https://github.com/INSAlgo/Concours-Puissance4/blob/6744ea0048b1145cb9d98b8c95a0c8e1bd6ad790/README.md])
You can pull and run the code that the bot uses to test your AI [here](https://github.com/INSAlgo/Concours-Puissance4)

# Save an AI on your name
To submit an AI, you must send the command `!p4 submit` with your file attached in a private message to <@1048680176118136942>.
Authorized languages :
 - python (.py)
 - javascript (.js)
 - C++ (.cpp)
 - C (.c)
 - Java (.java)
 - C# (.cs)
 - Rust (.rs)
The last AI you submitted will represent you at the tournament.

# Get the list of people who did submit an AI
Use `!p4 get` in the Connect 4 channel to see all the people taking part in the Connect 4 tournament.

# Test your AI against yourself
To play test your AI on the testing system, use `!p4 test`.
Add the flag `self` to play against the AI, otherwise it will play against itself.
You can also add the flag `first` after `self` to play first.
Logs of the game will be sent to you in a private message.
You can also add the `public` flag. This way, everyone will be able to see the game and access the logs in the 'Games' channel of the INSAlgo discord server.

# Test your AI against another AI
To challenge someone or someone's AI, use the command `!p4 challenge <user> <game_type>`.
Replace <user> with the tag of the person you want to challenge (e.g. name#1234).
Replace <game_type> with one of 4 game types :
- User_User : to play as yourself against them.
- User_AI : to play as yourself against their AI.
- AI_User : to play as your AI against them.
- AI_AI : to play as your AI against their AI.
At the end of the game, both competitors get the logs of the game.
Playing with/against an AI won't work if the concerned player has never submited any.
The opponent must accept for the game to start (obviously).
You can also add the `public` flag. This way, everyone will be able to see the game and access the logs in the 'Games' channel of the INSAlgo discord server.
