# Verifying Convex Hull
The function `!g CH {type}` tells you if the file you joined to the message is a convex hull.
The type is either 'points' or 'polygon' depending on which exercise you're verifying.
Your file must be formatted this way :
- the number of points (an integer)
- points as '{x} {y}' (in the order if it's a polygon)
- the number of points of the hull (an integer)
- points of the hull as '{x} {y}'
